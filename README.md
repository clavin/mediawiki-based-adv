# mediawiki-based-adv
An MediaWiki-text-based adventure. <sup>(Because making weird things is fun.)</sup>

This is just a fun little bot that takes some information from MediaWiki (in this case, English wikipedia) articles
and uses them as a chatbot response.

The bot attempts to use the words in responses as a context for what article it should grab its next response from, but
is very willing to fallback onto random responses too.

## Going on an Adventure?

The bot can be run by cloning this repo, installing the npm packages, and starting the script.

    $ git clone https://github.com/clavin/mediawiki-based-adv.git
    $ cd mediawiki-based-adv

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

And ta-da! You now should have a prompt to interact with the bot.
